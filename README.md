Just add this directory to path.

use `read_data` to read the `.dat` file from QTLab. (The .set file is currently ignored.)

Use `qtp` to plot the data. 

`read_data` can be used as a function `read_data('filename')`

`qtp` takes in optional arguments, the number being the value to be plotted against, by default plots all data.
